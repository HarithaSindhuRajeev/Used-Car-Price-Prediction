# Used-Car-Price-Prediction
* Through this code, I try to build machine learning models to undestand and analyse important factors affecting the used cars price. 
* I use exploratory data analysis for preliminary analysis
* I will show how missing values and unreasonable values are treated
* I build regression models (linear, lasso or ridge), decision tree, random forest and dother advanced models like XGBoost, GradientBoost to understand the data. 
* To figure out the best model, I will use, concepts like hypothesis testing, residuals, mean squared error, etc. 
* Using the finalized model, I conclude my insights and recommendations for growth in the market.
